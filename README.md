## About The Project

As part of a study project, we were asked to create a complete mobile application with React Native.

It is a Pokedex application that allows users to get all the existing Pokemons, obtain details about them and add the pokemon selected to a Pokedex. This app enables the user to search a pokemon by its name or its ID. This App is based on the Pokeapi.
